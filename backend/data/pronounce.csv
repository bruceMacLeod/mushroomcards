    * **epi-:** /ep-ih-/ (short ""i"" sound)
    * **-dendrum:** /-DEN-drum/ (the emphasis is on the second syllable, ""DEN"")


**Explanation of the pronunciation rules used:**

English Scientific Latin pronunciation generally follows these guidelines:

* **Vowels:**  A, E, I, O, U are generally pronounced as in Italian or Spanish.  ""Long"" and ""short"" vowel distinctions are less crucial than in classical Latin, but are often retained for clarity.
* **Consonants:**  Most consonants are pronounced as in English, except for:
    * **c before i or e:** pronounced as /s/ (as in ""city"")
    * **c before a, o, u:** pronounced as /k/ (as in ""cat"")
    * **g before i or e:** pronounced as /j/ (as in ""gem"")
    * **g before a, o, u:** pronounced as /g/ (as in ""go"")
    * **ch:** usually pronounced /k/ (as in ""chaos"")
    * **ti before a vowel:** usually pronounced /tsi/ or /tʃi/ (as in ""nation"" or ""picture,"" depending on the specific word and accent).  In *epidendrum* it's closer to /tʃi/.

* **Stress:**  The stress in scientific names is often less strictly defined than in classical Latin. Generally, it falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable unless there's a specific reason otherwise.  For binomial nomenclature (genus and species), stress typically falls on the penult of the genus name and a variable syllable of the species name.

Remember that these are guidelines, and some variations in pronunciation exist among scientists and speakers.  The key is consistency within a given context.

* **Vowels:**  A, E, I, O, U are generally pronounced as in English (though the ""a"" can sometimes sound more like ""ah"" than ""ay"").  Diphthongs (like ""ae"" in this case) are treated as a single sound.

* **Consonants:**  Mostly pronounced as in English, though some may have slight variations.

* **Stress:**  Stress (emphasis) usually falls on the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end) of the genus name, unless that syllable is a short, unstressed syllable.  The specific epithet typically has stress on the antepenultimate syllable if it's a longer word.


It's worth noting that minor variations in pronunciation exist across individuals and regions, but the above guidelines provide a generally accepted approach for pronouncing *Jackrogersella cohaerens*.
